# Contributing

Thanks for even looking at the code. Like I said in the README, I built this for fun and I'm still learning the ropes of TypeScript.

If you see something that looks like a total mess or if you have a way to make the DOM observation even faster, please drop a Pull Request! 

### How to help:
1. Fork the repo.
2. Make your changes (keep it clean if you can lmao).
3. Submit a PR with a quick note on what you fixed/improved.

Let's make this plugin actually decent together. Peace
